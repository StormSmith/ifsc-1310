  <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
  <p>
    Progressive enhancement is basically a mindset people in web design use that lets them concentrate on building a website while being able to find problems they may run into while making the website. It's kind of like a step by step list, first you start with the content of the website(html), then you work on the way the website looks (css), then finally you add the javascript to it.

  <h1>SpaceX Revision</h1>
  <p>I showed a few family members my website, and they said it was very bland and basic. So, what I tried to do was add a little bit more to it to make it more visual appealing. I changed the default font to something more nice looking, and added the spacex logo, because for some reason I forgot to add the logo. Another thing I did was add a slideshow of pictures of the spacex shuttle and various other things to give the person viewing the website something to look at. </p>
  <p>This semester was a big learning curve for me, because I've never really done any type of coding coming into these types of classes. With Web Technologies and Programming, i've had to learn various languages like, html, css, C++, and a little bit of python. Overall, I feel like this has been a very successful semester for me. Some things that I did well was being able to stay on top of my work for the most part and get it turned in on time. Something that I would do differently is probably ask for help more, I went into this semester trying to just figure everything out with the sources that were given to my by myself, and it worked well at first, but I ended up struggling at the end. With it being the year of covid, and not getting to do in-person classes I ended up staying in and not getting to meet people, but fortuntely I've made a few friends that have helped me figure out all of these different coding languages. </p>
